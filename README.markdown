Dependencies required
---------------------

The commands below use the switch to ignore dependencies, as the needed
dependencies are included in Collective's local gems repo.

Merb Core 0.9.5:

<pre>
$ gem install merb-core -v 0.9.5 --ignore-dependencies
</pre>

A Data Objects Database Adapter:

<pre>
$ gem install do_sqlite3(or)do_mysql(or)do_postgres -v 0.9.5 --ignore-dependencies
</pre>

ParseTree (Collective uses merb-action-args which depends on ParseTree):

<pre>
$ gem install ParseTree
</pre>

Spam Protection
---------------

Collective supports protection against spam using either the Akismet or
Defensio API via Viking. By default this support is disabled. To enable
support you will need to create a configuration file named 
spam\_protection.yml in the config directory. A sample file is available
for you in  config/spam\_protection.yml.sample.

Your configuration file must:
  * have the name of your desired spam protection service. Available options
    include: 'akismet', 'defensio', or blank (i.e. disabled).
  * have both your API key and 'blog' connection options included. See the
    documentation for your service of choice for details on these options.
