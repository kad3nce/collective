A new version of English has been released!

  http://english.rubyforge.org

English is a spin off project from Facets, collecting
together all the english/language libraries together
under a single unified roof.

This version incorporate some new libraries incorporated from 
various sources and cleans up the library as a whole.
It should be a pretty usable little library now.
