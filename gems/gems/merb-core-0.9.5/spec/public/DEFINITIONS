==== Public API
This is the API that is available in your app itself. Anything not in the public API is subject to change.

==== Semipublic API
This is the API that is guaranteed to be available between components of Merb. If something in the semipublic
API changes, this will likely require changes in other parts of Merb. Additionally, items in the semipublic
API can be relied upon for introspection, for testing purposes.

For instance, AbstractController#_body should not be used in Merb apps themselves, as it may change, but
it may be used in other components of Merb and in the Merb tests themselves. Including it in the semipublic
API is designed to alert Merb's maintainers that changing it will have framework-wide repercussions.
