= Description
This is a fork of Technoweenie's Rails plugin, Viking. It is meant to bring 
Viking to other Ruby web frameworks by gem-ifying the plugin, and extending it 
with a few of the additions that were generated by the Collective project 
(http://github.com/meekish/collective).

For more information on how to use this gem, check out the well documented 
code, and the "website":http://vikinggem.rubyforge.org/
