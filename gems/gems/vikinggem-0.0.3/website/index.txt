h1. VikingGem

h2. What

Spam in your inbox and spam on your blog. The only place spam isn't is on your 
dinner plate (I hope). 

Luckily there are two great services available to help keep spam at bay on 
your blog: "Akismet&trade;":akismet, and "Defensio&trade;":defensio. Both 
services can be integrated into your application to help fend off spam. 

Based on the excellent "Ruby on Rails&trade;":ror 
"plugin of the same name":http://github.com/technoweenie/viking/tree/master, 
VikingGem brings you easy access to the "Akismet&trade;":akismet, and 
"Defensio&trade;":defensio spam protection services, but without the need for 
you to use "Rails&trade;":ror. VikingGem is Ruby web framework agnostic.

VikingGem also provides a few extra tweaks, and a slightly cleaner code base 
to make it easier for you to dive in and grok its inner-workings.
