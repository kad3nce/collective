- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A Capsule is subclass of Module. It encapsulates an extenal script as a funcitons module.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A module which is an instance of the Capsule class encapsulates in its scope the top-level methods, top-level constants, and instance variables defined in a ruby script file (and its subfiles) loaded by a ruby program. This allows use of script files to define objects that can be loaded into a program in much the same way that objects can be loaded from YAML or Marshal files.

  body: See intro.txt[link:files/intro_txt.html] for an overview.
