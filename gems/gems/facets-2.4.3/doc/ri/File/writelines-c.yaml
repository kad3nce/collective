- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Writes the given array of data to the given path and closes the file. This is done in binary mode, complementing <tt>IO.readlines</tt> in standard Ruby.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Note that <tt>readlines</tt> (the standard Ruby method) returns an array of lines <em>with newlines intact</em>, whereas <tt>writelines</tt> uses <tt>puts</tt>, and so appends newlines if necessary. In this small way, <tt>readlines</tt> and <tt>writelines</tt> are not exact opposites.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns <tt>nil</tt>.
