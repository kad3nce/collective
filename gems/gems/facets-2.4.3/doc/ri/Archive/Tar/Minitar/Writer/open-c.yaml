  body: With no associated block, +Writer::open+ is a synonym for +Writer::new+. If the optional code block is given, it will be passed the new <em>writer</em> as an argument and the Writer object will automatically be closed when the block terminates. In this instance, +Writer::open+ returns the value of the block.
