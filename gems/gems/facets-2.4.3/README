  "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO RUBY"


== Introduction

Ruby Facets is the single largest collection of general purpose method extensions and system additions for the Ruby programming language.

The core extensions is a large collection of methods which extend the core capabilities of Ruby's built-in classes and modules. This collection of extension methods are unique by virtue of their atomicity. The methods are stored in relatively small groups of tightly coupled methods so that each can be required independently. This gives developers the potential for much finer control over which extra methods to bring into their code.

The "more" additions are a collection of classes, modules and light meta-systems which constitutes an ever improving source of reusable components. Some very nice additions are provided, from the simple Functor class to a full-blown annotations system.


== Documentation

Facets has special documentation needs due to it's extensive bredth. For this reason, RDocs are not automatically generated when installing via RubyGems. Unfortunatgely this also prevents RI docs from being created. Hopefully we can remedy this in the future. In the mean time you can manually create them by navigating to the package directory (either the gem or tgz) and running 'rdoc --ri-site' (recommended destination).

Online documentaiton is available at http://facets.rubyforge.org/learn.html. There is a "Quick Doc" feature that can be a bit more convenient then the usual RDocs. Prior to 2.3.1 off-line docs had to be downloaded via a separate package, but this is no longer the case. I've seen past the stigma of not including documentation along with the package itself (the extra 500K isn't even a floppy disk folks!), so you will find them in the doc/ directory of whatever package you have choosen to install. In fact, a good package installer should give you the option to install those in the appropriate place in your system (eg. in /usr/share/doc/facets/).


== Release Notes

Please see the NEWS file.


== Changes

Please see the CHANGES file.


== Installation

The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.

  $ gem install facets

To install manually, download and unpack the .tar.gz package and use the included
task/install script. Eg.

  $ tar -xvzf facets-2.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd facets-2.x.x
  $ sudo task/setup

On Window the last step will be:

  C:\> ruby task/setup

IMPORTANT! Note that setup.rb is no longer used b/c of Facets' new layout.


== Compatibility with 1.x series.

Prior to 2.0, Facets was divided between CORE and MORE --standalone extensions vs. classes and modules, respectively. With 2.0, the notion of "CORE" has taken on a slightly different meaning. Instead CORE now consists of the libraries that are thought essential and as such are loaded automatically when using ++require "facets"++. While still primarily made up of extension methods modules and classes may now belong to core as well.

The other significant change from 1.x to 2.0 is the removal of some libraries that were considered too extraneous for a general purpose library. Most of these were spun-off to their own projects. In particular, the web-related libs are now part of Blow (http://blow.rubyforge.org), inflection libraries are in English (http://english.rubyforge.org), units.rb along with constants.rb are in Stick (http://stick.rubyforge.org), and the persistance system in Opod (http://opod.rubyforge.org).


== Mission

Facets holds to the notion that the more we can reasonably integrate into a common foundation directed toward general needs, the better that foundation will be able to serve everyone. There are a number of advantages here:

    * Better Code-reuse
    * Collaborative Improvements
    * Greater Name Consistency
    * One-stop Shop and Installation


== Usage

For information in usage, please see the special README for the specific set of libraries:

  README.core     Core extensions
  README.lore     Standard extensions
  README.more     Additions

Using a Facets/MORE library of modules, classes or microframeworks is essentially the same. For example:

  require 'facets/basicobject'

Again, for details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please see the API Docs.


== Contribute

This project thrives on contribution.

If you have any extension methods, classes, modules or small frameworks that you think have general applicability and would like to see them included in this project, don't hesitiate to submit. There's a very good chance they will be included.  Also, if you have better versions of any thing already included or simply have a patch, they too are more than welcome. We want Ruby Facets to be of the highest quality.
