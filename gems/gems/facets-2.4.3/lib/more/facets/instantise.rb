# = Instantise
#
# Instantise converts module methods into instance methods
# such that the first parameter is passed self at the instance level.
# This promotes DRY programming when wishing to offer both an inheritable
# and a module callable procedure.
#
#   module MyModule
#     extend Instantise
#
#     def self.jumble( obj, arg )
#       obj + arg
#     end
#   end
#
#   class String
#     include MyModule
#   end
#
#   MyModule.jumble( "Try", "Me" )  #=> "TryMe"
#
#   "Try".jumble( "Me" )            #=> 'TryMe'
#
# == Notes
#
# This module used to be called PromoteSelf. Instantise is more descriptive, but 
# a better name is probably still out there.
