class Hash

  # Returns a new hash created by traversing the hash and its subhashes,
  # executing the given block on the key and value. The block should
  # return a 2-element array of the form +[key, value]+.
  #
  #   h = { "A"=>"A", "B"=>"B" }
  #   g = h.traverse { |k,v| [k.downcase, v] }
  #   g  #=> { "a"=>"A", "b"=>"B" }
  #
  # TODO: Contrast these to recursibely --we may not need both.
  #
  # TODO: Testing value to see if it is a Hash also catches subclasses of Hash.
  #       This is probably not the right thing to do and should catch Hashes only (?)
